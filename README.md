# Student-managment-system
Student Management System is based on the concept of managing student information. Before stepping into the main menu a user has to pass through a login system to get access, then the user can manage student information by adding, updating, removing, viewing and searching for details.

You can run this project simply after installing jdk8 and then compile and run it.
